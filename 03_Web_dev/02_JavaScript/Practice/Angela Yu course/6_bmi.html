  //Create your function below this line.

  // function bmiCalculator(weight, height) {
  //   var bmi = Math.floor(weight / (height * height));

  // If my weight is 65Kg and my height is 1.8m, I should be able to call your function like this:

<!-- Previously, we've created a function that is able to calculate the BMI. But once we get a result, we will want to tell the user what the number means.
Write a function that outputs (returns) a different message depending on the BMI.

BMI <18.5, the output should be: "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are underweight."
BMI 18.5-24.9, the output should be "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you have a normal weight."
BMI >24.9, the output should be "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are overweight."

The message MUST be returned as an output from your function. You should NOT NEED to use alert, prompt or console.log in this challenge.
IMPORTANT the message wording has to match precisely for the code to pass the validation. Including punctuation and capitalisation. -->
